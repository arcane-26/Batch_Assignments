    "Multithreading in Python programming is a well-known technique in which multiple threads in a programm share their data space with the main thread which makes information sharing and communication within threads easy and efficient.Multiple threads may execute individually while sharing their program resources. The use of multithreading is to run multiple tasks and function cells at the same time. 'threading' module is used the handle threads in python"
